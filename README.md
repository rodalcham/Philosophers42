# Philosophers

A 42 school project

Youâ€™ve just been hired by a reclusive and rather eccentric scientist, notorious for his unorthodox experiments.<br>
This time, he has outdone himself by kidnapping a group of philosophers and subjecting them to <br>
a peculiar and potentially perilous dining situation.<br>

Your mission, as his newest assistant, is to ensure that these kidnapped philosophers,<br>
who are forced to share a limited number of chopsticks, can eat and stay alive.<br>
It is your job to manage their eating and sleeping schedules so they don't starve, endangering their lifes<br>
and perhaps even you own.<br>

Here are some notes you may use to aid you in this bizarre experiment:<br>

| ./philosophers|    number      |   time to die   |    time to eat    |   time to sleep    |   number of meals \<optional\>  |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| **MIN**       |       2        |  eat + sleep    |         1         |         1          |               1                 |
| **MAX**       |      200       |                 |                   |                    |                                 |

Welcome to the Dining Philosophers Simulation. Can you keep this captives alive?<br>
