# Philosophers

A 42 school project by **_@rchavez_**

You’ve just been hired by a reclusive and rather eccentric scientist known only as Dr. Malum.
He’s notorious for his unorthodox experiments and twisted sense of humor.
This time, Dr. Malum has outdone himself by kidnapping a group of philosophers and subjecting them to a peculiar and potentially perilous dining situation.

Your mission, as his newest assistant, is to ensure that these kidnapped philosophers, who are forced to share a limited number of chopsticks, can eat and stay alive. The challenge lies in managing their eating and sleeping schedules so they don't starve while maintaining their sanity under the bizarre circumstances.

In this simulation, you will juggle the logistics of the dining table where each philosopher must pick up two chopsticks to eat from a common bowl of noodles. With hunger gnawing at their patience and survival hanging by a thread, your role is crucial. Get ready to dive into the chaotic and thought-provoking world of the Dining Philosophers, where every decision can mean the difference between life and death.

Welcome to the Philosophers Dining Simulation. Can you keep Dr. Malum's captives alive?
